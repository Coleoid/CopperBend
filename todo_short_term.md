===  CB short-term todo

Make the 'tackle blight bare-handed' decision once only


---  Notes on process

Each of these should be in a form to be a commit message.
* Concrete present tense verb as first word
* Leading capital, no period
* Comfortably finishes the sentence "Applying this commit will..."

'Fix' or 'Change' or 'Do' might be okay, but they're a smell.
Same with 'Add' and 'Make', to a lesser degree.
  The smell is "Not Wrong, but Vague".  See if the message can be sharpened.  This is for later enlightenment, which I value.  It's worth taking a moment of focus now.
