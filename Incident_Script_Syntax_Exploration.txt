Flow decide_to_see_farm

Merotta:
    say "He's clean.  Any fool can see that.  That cursed crap's always easy to see."

Belo:
    move to meeting_table
    (@ ^.start) say "And it's always changing.  Bock says that Rot thing hit the stranger and fell apart?  Doesn't sound right.  What if it _went into_ him?"

Merotta:
    say "Then we would see it.  Or smell it!"

Kellet:
    say "Bock saw him work the land.  Tacker's place--filthy, now.  So this:  When I fetched him back, what I saw, where he worked:  Clean land.  Sprouts.  Redfruit and beans, I think.  This."

Belo:
    wait 36
    say "Bock, show me.  Before it gets dark.  Runcel, come with us."
    create party Tacker (Belo, Bock, Runcel)

End flow

Notes:
    // (@ .start) means this action begins at the start of this flow
    // [= r_leaving_1] means this action has this label

    // ^ means prior action, defaults to end, can do ^.start, ^.end
    // Default timing on actions is after the prior action is done.
    // ?? may be useful to chain via ^^^ ?
    // Could have done same with 'wait 24', 'say "What?"'

    move to (within 2)
    move onto (within 0)
    move within 5
    stay within 5?


---  This one is nonsensical:
Flow [= Bock_is_generally_hyper]  ()

Bock:
    shuffle friends into friend_deck

Bock:
    deal from friend_deck into Chosen_friend
    move to Chosen_friend
    say $Chosen_friend.name + "!"
    say "Rutabaga, rutabaga!"
    wait 60
    restart unless friend_deck.empty

End flow
