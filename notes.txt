===  Save/Load synchronizing

--- The GoRogue IDGenerator
What will a unit test tell me about how it works?

It tells me that the returned ids simply start at 0 and increment by 1.
  So long as this doesn't change, when serializing, we can get and store:

    int nextID = gen.UseID();

...and after serialize/deserialize, it has a constructor:

    var gen = new IDGenerator(nextID);

...so we're golden, we just store nextID.

---
We need to allow the deserializer to set the IDs on all our deser'd objects, rather than gen them.

Quickly trying a couple of approaches, I liked adding an id arg on the constructors, with a default of uint.MaxValue, and going to the generator for the value if we get the default.
    Usage in the normal app doesn't change
    No additional constructors or methods
    No need to allow outside write access to the IDs

This will give us reliable sync of entity IDs across save/load, which is one element of being able to save/load the schedule.


--- RNGs

We want to preserve the sequence of numbers generated whether the game was saved and reloaded or not.  Debugging from save files.

Distillation of reading and unit tests is:

GoRogue uses the Troschuetz RNG library, whose generators are all marked [Serializable], and the implementations are open.  That seems to be the correct play, here.

The next step, some tests prove that serializing, then deserializing to a new object keeps the sequence.  Discarding options:

  The (convenient) .Net Random class is incompatible between .Net framework versions, and (crucially) doesn't guarantee the same series from the same seed.  Doesn't suit our needs.

  The (strong, very long-period) MersenneTwister serializes (Base64) to 3.7k characters.  I expect that I'll have several (many?) specific-purpose RNGs in the full game, which could really bulk up the save file.

  The (extra fast) XorShift128 generator has bad internal seeding (in this version of the Troschuetz library), so at least its first values are badly unrandom.  If it's fixed later, it may well not deserialize its sequence across versions.

I'm choosing, for now, the NR3 generator.  It seems plenty fast for me, and is the recommended choice in "a famous numerical analysis book".  The Troschuetz library includes two faster variants (and other fast algorithms) in case I ever find it's slow enough to notice.  It serializes (Base64) to under 500 characters.  This may eventually bother me, in which case I can seek gains by writing a custom serialization that only saves/restores the members of the generators which hold state.  Tiny, but I'd need to dive into the guts.

Last hurdle:
  I'm doing saves in YAML format.  The YamlDotNet serialization won't serialize the RNG object directly.  So, I serialize the NR3 generator with .NET serialization, convert the resulting bytes to a Base64 string, and stick that in a string property of my save object.  Reverse the steps to load, test passes.
  I YAML'd the byte array, which worked, yet was FUGLY--one line per byte in the resulting file, plus indentation, punctuation, and byte represented as int.  Terrible, and still opaque.  Base64 is my buddy.  I aim for the save files to remain readable, hackable, and a debugging tool.


--- The schedule

Another element is getting the lambdas out of the schedule.
  So how does that look?
  For any particular ScheduleAgent, an action name and arbitrary data are enough.
    (Not that deserializing arbitrary data structures is trivial, when structure type is unknown.)

For non-agent occurrences?  Wrap them in thematic agents?
Perhaps there's a pre-agent dispatcher which performs many standard actions...
Perhaps the structure of the domain entities holding behavior logic is not a good fit here.

I began with different classes for different plant types, which gave me technical problems to begin with, and which also raises the bar for modding to a really rugged place.

Now I've got a data object holding specifics of each sort of growing thing, available to the involved classes.  We'll see how long that's enough.  Will it keep working well for directing more complex effects of plants?  Like, this fruit heals, that fruit buffs speed, this plant will grab hostiles passing over it for a few seconds, and so on.
    Ooh.  I gotta call that "grabgrass".


This details object also holds the randomized descriptions and player knowledge.  This is convenient, but those data need to be persisted for game save/load, where the rest of the data don't.  Saving invariant data will bloat save files.  (But also provide some insulation against upgrades invalidating saves?)

Oh, it also provides a basis for hybrid/created plant types...
